# Compact AGI with Versatile Language Models (MultiLM-AGI)

MultiLM-AGI is a project that aims to create a simple but efficient Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) agent using Golang and a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) compatible with the LLMClient interface. The agent is engineered to handle a variety of tasks by refining its objectives, executing tasks, evaluating results, and prioritizing subsequent tasks. With its adaptable architecture, MultiLM-AGI can be applied across various domains, including gaming, problem-solving, and knowledge acquisition.

**Please note that this project is still under development, and its individual-level efficiency has not yet been thoroughly established. However, given the escalating interest in the development of general artificial intelligence, we believe it's crucial to share the potential worth of this project and collaboratively evolve it with the community. Hence, we request your continued support and understanding.**

## Key Features

- **Objective Refinement**: An innovative approach to refine a larger objective into smaller, more manageable objectives that allow the AGI agent to tackle complex issues.
- Task Creation: Generates tasks and milestones based on the refined objectives.
- Execution Agent: Executes tasks using the OpenAI GPT-4 model (or GPT-3.5 model).
- Evaluation Agent: Evaluates the task results and their effectiveness.
- Prioritization Agent: Prioritizes tasks based on their relevance and importance.
- Task Context Agent: Stores the task context for future reference.
- **In-Memory Vector Store**: Efficient in-memory vector store to save embedding vectors for similarity queries, enabling faster access and improved performance.
